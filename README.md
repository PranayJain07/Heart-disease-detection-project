##  Dataset Information

The dataset contains medical attributes commonly used to detect heart disease, such as:

- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest pain type  
- Resting blood pressure  
- Cholesterol level  
- Fasting blood sugar  
- Resting ECG results  
- Maximum heart rate achieved  
- Exercise-induced angina  
- ST depression  
- Number of major vessels  
- Target (0 = No disease, 1 = Disease)
